# CompetitiveProgramming
Competitive programming is a branch of coding where people solve algorithmic problems within a certain time limit. Within this repository are submodules linking to all my repositories that have a connection to competitive programming, whether it be a repository containing solution code to a problem solving website or a repository containing solution code to an actual contest or anything else. Further descriptions will be most likely found within the submodules themselves.
